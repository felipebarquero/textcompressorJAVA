About Text Compressor for Java
==========


****************************************

**Text Compressor using Huffmann codes.**

****************************************

## Description of the Problem
One of the great paradigms of computing is the efficient use of
the memory that allows the information to be stored and transmitted. It is for this
reason that in the decade, computer scientists sought to invent a binary code
make it as efficient as possible. David Hufmann in 1951 publishes a
article on a method of building codes with the minimum quantity
of redundancies. His method was truly revolutionary since Hufmann
demonstrated that his method produces the most efficient code.
In this small project we will implement the Hufmann code to compress
and unzip a text file.


## Methodology
The Methodology used in this project consisted of decomposing the
I work on small sub-tasks (reading the characters of the text,
creation of the list, the construction of the binary tree, the serialization of the
objects,...). The performance of these sub-tasks was completely sequential,
in the way in which the problem statement and instructions are stated.


```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

- 	General numerical algorithms like
    - Generation of random numbers
    - Optimization (a Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is provided)
- Monte-Carlo simulation of multi-dimensional, multi-factor stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
    - LIBOR Market Model
    - Black Scholes type multi-asset model (multi-factor, multi-dimensional geometric Brownian motion)
    - Equity Hybrid LIBOR Market Model
    - Hull-White Short Rate Model (with time dependent parameters)
    - Merton Model (as Monte-Carlo Simulation)
    - Heston Model (as Monte-Carlo Simulation)
- Estimation of conditional expectations in a Monte-Carlo framework
- Calibration of market data objects like curves (discount and forward curve) or volatility surfaces
    - Various interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, harmonic spline, Akima).
    - Various interpolation entities (value, log-value, rate, etc.).
    - Parametric curves like Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel-Svensson.
- Simulation of interest rate term structure models (LIBOR market model with local and stochastic volatility)
- Calibration of the LIBOR market model
- Valuation of complex derivatives (e.g. Bermudan/multi-callables)
- Hedge Simulation

The libraries have a focus on Monte-Carlo methods, interest rate products and models and hybrid models.

**finmath lib is now on Java 8 (since February 2nd, 2014), but a Java 6 version is provided too.**

*Note: for convenience the provided Eclipse project is configured for Java 6. The maven pom defaults to Java 6. To build the Java 8 version use the profile "java-8", i.e. the maven command line option "-P java-8"*

Distribution
--------------------------------------

finmath lib is distributed through the central maven repository. It's coordinates are:

For the Java 6 version:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
	<classifier>java6</classifier>

For the Java 8 version:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
	
You may build the Java 8 version via Maven using

	mvn -P java-8

and the Java 6 version using

	mvn -P java-6
	
Source code
-------------------------------------

The finmath lib Java library comes in two flavors which have a slightly different code base: a Java 8 version and a Java 6 version.
We will use Java 8 concepts in the future and try to provide Java 6 compatibility where possible.

For that reason, the source code is duplicated:
-    src/main/java				contains the Java 8 compatible source files
-    src/main/java6				contains the Java 6 compatible source files

Although the two folder share some/many identical source files, we prefer this two folder layout
over one with a third folder like java-common.


### Building finmath lib

-    To build finmath lib for Java 8 use src/main/java
-    To build finmath lib for java 6 use src/main/java-6

These builds may be performed via Maven the profiles "java-8" and "java-6".
The eclipse project file is pre-configured to Java 6.

#### Maven build

The maven pom defaults to the Java 8 build. To build finmath lib for Java 6 use the maven profile "java-6".



Repositories
-------------------------------------

Source code and demos are provided via Github repository.
			<ul>

Although not recommeded, the repository contains an Eclipse procject and classpath file including all dependencies. We provide this for convenience. We provide <a href="/java/subversion">instructions</a> on how to checkout the code using the Eclipse IDE.
Of course, you may use the IDE of your choice by simply importing the maven pom.
